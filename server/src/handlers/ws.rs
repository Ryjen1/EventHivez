//! WebSocket handler for real-time ticket purchase updates.
//!
//! Dashboard clients connect to `GET /api/v1/ws/purchases` and receive
//! [`PurchaseEvent`] messages as JSON whenever a ticket sale is processed.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! A single [`PurchaseBroadcaster`] (held in shared app state) owns a
//! `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel. The ticket purchase handler calls
//! [`PurchaseBroadcaster::publish`] after a successful sale; every connected
//! WebSocket client receives the message independently.
